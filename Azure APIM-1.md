General Overview

1.  **What is Azure API Management?**\
    Azure API Management is a service that enables organizations to
    create, manage, and secure APIs. It acts as a gateway to streamline
    API traffic management, authentication, and monitoring.

2.  **What are the key features of Azure API Management?**\
    Features include API gateway, developer portal, API analytics,
    policy enforcement, security, versioning, and scalability.

3.  **How does Azure API Management help in API lifecycle management?**\
    It facilitates API design, publishing, versioning, monitoring, and
    retirement, providing a complete lifecycle management solution.

Configuration and Setup

4.  **How do you create an API in Azure API Management?**\
    APIs can be created by importing OpenAPI, Swagger, or WSDL
    definitions, or by manually defining endpoints and operations.

5.  **What authentication mechanisms does Azure API Management
    support?**\
    It supports various authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0, API
    keys, client certificates, Azure Active Directory, and more.

6.  **How can caching be configured in Azure API Management?**\
    Caching policies can be defined to cache responses, reducing backend
    load and improving performance. You can configure caching duration
    and rules.

Integration and Transformation

7.  **How does Azure API Management handle backend integration?**\
    It integrates with backend services by defining backend entities,
    including URLs, protocols, and authentication mechanisms.

8.  **What is policy enforcement in Azure API Management?**\
    Policies are rules applied to APIs to modify requests and responses.
    These can include transformations, authentication, rate limiting,
    and logging.

9.  **Can Azure API Management transform incoming or outgoing
    requests/responses?**\
    Yes, it supports request/response transformation using policies to
    modify data formats, headers, or content.

Monitoring and Analytics

10. **What kind of analytics does Azure API Management provide?**\
    It offers insights into API usage, performance, errors, and latency,
    enabling organizations to optimize their APIs.

11. **How can Azure API Management be monitored?**\
    Monitoring can be done through the Azure portal or by using Azure
    Monitor to collect and analyze data on API usage and performance.

12. **Can Azure API Management be integrated with third-party analytics
    tools?**\
    Yes, it supports integration with external analytics tools through
    log exporting or Azure Monitor.

Security and Access Control

13. **How does Azure API Management ensure API security?**\
    It provides features like authentication, authorization, SSL
    termination, and IP filtering to secure APIs.

14. **Can API Management enforce rate limits on incoming requests?**\
    Yes, rate limiting policies can be set to control the number of
    requests allowed from an individual client or for an API.

15. **Does Azure API Management support role-based access control?**\
    Yes, it integrates with Azure Active Directory to manage access
    control using RBAC.

Scale and Performance

16. **How does Azure API Management handle scalability?**\
    It can be scaled vertically by changing the tier or horizontally by
    adding more instances to handle increased API traffic.

17. **What are the different pricing tiers available for Azure API
    Management?**\
    Tiers include Consumption, Developer, Basic, Standard, and Premium,
    offering varying features and scalability options.

18. **Is there any limit on the number of APIs that can be managed in
    Azure API Management?**\
    The limit varies based on the pricing tier but generally allows for
    managing a significant number of APIs.

Troubleshooting and Debugging

19. **How can errors in API requests be debugged in Azure API
    Management?**\
    Error details are logged and can be viewed through the Azure portal
    or extracted via logging services for analysis.

20. **What tools are available for troubleshooting API issues in Azure
    API Management?**\
    Azure Portal provides insights, and tools like Azure Monitor,
    Application Insights, and Log Analytics can be integrated for
    in-depth analysis.

Absolutely, let's dive into some trickier scenarios and questions
related to Azure API Management:

Scenario-Based Questions

1.  **Scenario:**\
    *An organization wants to migrate its existing APIs to Azure API
    Management. How would you approach this migration process?*

2.  **Scenario:**\
    *You have multiple APIs with different authentication mechanisms.
    How can Azure API Management handle these varying authentication
    methods efficiently?*

3.  **Scenario:**\
    *An API endpoint is experiencing high traffic, resulting in
    performance issues. What strategies can be employed within Azure API
    Management to mitigate this problem without affecting the API
    functionality?*

4.  **Scenario:**\
    *You're tasked with implementing custom policies in Azure API
    Management to transform incoming XML requests into JSON responses.
    How would you accomplish this task?*

5.  **Scenario:**\
    *A developer has accidentally exposed sensitive data through an API
    endpoint. How can Azure API Management prevent such data exposures
    in the future, and what steps can be taken to rectify the current
    situation?*

Tricky Questions

1.  **Question:**\
    *Can Azure API Management enforce different rate limits based on
    user roles or subscription plans?*

2.  **Question:**\
    *How does Azure API Management handle versioning of APIs, especially
    in scenarios where backward compatibility is crucial?*
