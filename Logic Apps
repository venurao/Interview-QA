1. What is used for development of Logic app?
-  Logic app development can be done online by using Azure portal and offline by using visual studio by adding the required supporting sdk.

2. What is difference between Logic App and Power Automate(Microsoft flow)?
- Power Automate is targeted for Business users(for using that they need to get License) whereas Logic app is targeted for developers.
  Power Automate is build on top of Logic Apps however it is meant to be truly a “no-code approach” to build automation and integration.
  And it does not support any Enterprise connectors, no governance and no Integration with Azure DevOps for CI/CD deployment.

3.How is logic app instantiated?
-  Logic Apps gets instantiated(started) by a Trigger. 
   Trigger types available are : 
   Http
   HttpWebhook
   Request (endpoint)
   Recurrence (schedule)
   ApiConnection
   ApiConnectionWebhook

4.What are the mechanisms supported by Logic App Trigger?
- Logic app trigger support following mechanisms
   Schedule (Time based)
   Push (Client application pushes the data to Logic App e.g, Http Trigger)
   Pull  (Logic app probes the client application for data, if found it fetches the data e.g., Servicebus queue trigger)
   Manual (Irrespective of trigger used, Logic app can be manually trigger with the help of Run )

5.What is an Action in Logic App?
- Each step in a logic app is an Action. It can be anything from control workflow actions (condition, foreach, switch, terminate etc), 
  data manipulation actions (compose, filter array, .create csv table, join etc), 
  integration account actions( xml validation, transformation, flat file decoding/encoding etc) etc.

6.What is difference between Action and trigger?
- Trigger is also an Action but a special action. It is the first action in the workflow which has the capability to instantiate the workflow. 
  It may or may not contain data associated with it.

7.Why Run After property not available with Trigger?
- Run After property supports 4 status - Success, Failed, Skipped, Timeout. 
  The successor(next action) relies on the status of the predecessor(previous action), so accordingly it decide what to do. 
  However in case of Trigger there is only one status i.e. success . Only if trigger is success then next step in workflow comes into picture. 
  Just think, if you fail at first step - there can't be next step. But yes, you can retry and that property is available with Trigger.

8.Can we Clone a logic app from one resource group to another resource group?
- No. This option is not there.
  You can clone logic app only in same resource group and in same subscription.

9. How is Logic App Charged?
- Based on the deployment model chosen
  ISE - Flat cost (Fixed)
  Consumption - Per action execution is charged
  Standard - Based on a hosting plan with a selected pricing tier.

10. Can we have long running logic app?
- It depends on the deployment plan you have chosen.
For ISE maximum is 366 days, whereas 90 days for consumption and standard stateful and 5 mins for standard stateless.
